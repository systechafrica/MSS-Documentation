    target lump sum and AVC that will enable you to achieve the target
    IRR for at least 10 years.

The calculator uses your recent contributions (EE+ER+AVC) to project and
determine the amount of lump sum package and IRR that you may receive at
the specified exit age. The financial constraints passed will be applied
accordingly. See the next illustration.
